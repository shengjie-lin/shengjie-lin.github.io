As a cross-disciplinary endeavor to bring robotics engineering to artistic creation, I designed the hardware system and developed the software framework for `Infant`, an interactive installation demonstrating a digital infant's reaction to external stimuli. The idea of `Infant` is jointly devised with a student from the School of the Art Institute of Chicago (SAIC), and the project was featured in the 2020 SAIC Shows.

* With nerual style transfer, the infant's state of alertness and comfort level are visualized via the gradation of art style in its skin texture.
* With face detection and tracking, the infant gets alerted by approaching and leaving of audiences. Such alert attenuates as the same audience stays longer within sight.
* With audio sensing, the infant is also alerted by playful sounds. However, loud noises discomfort the infant.
* With pressure data processing, the infant's comfort level is affected by touching. Gentle and steady touches comfort the infant, while sudden and strong ones discomfort it.
* With pulse sensing,
