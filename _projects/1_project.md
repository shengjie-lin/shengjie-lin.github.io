I led other members of the RIPL lab at TTIC in the development of software to empower the Baxter robot to follow a human's pose in real time. We installed our system at the Museum of Science and Industry in Chicago for the 2022 and 2023 National Robotics Week. The installation gained great popularity during both exhibits, and had the honor to be kept by the Museum for regular showcase.

* With the RGB-D image stream captured by an Intel RealSense camera, we used a deep learning model to detect human poses, implemented a robust algorithm to track the highlighted pose over frames while identifying the intetion to tranfer focus.
