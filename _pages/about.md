I am currently a 6th year PhD student at [Toyota Technological Institute at Chicago](https://www.ttic.edu/) studying computer vision, robotics and machine learning under the supervision of [Prof. Matthew R. Walter](https://home.ttic.edu/~mwalter/). Before coming to TTIC, I received the Bachelor's degree in Electronic Engineering from [Tsinghua University](https://www.tsinghua.edu.cn/en/) in 2017, being awarded Outstanding Gradute and Outstanding Thesis by the department.

My research interests lie in the intersection of computer vision, robotics and machine learning. I am particularly interested in developing algorithms that enable robots to understand the world around them and interact with it in a natural and intuitive way. My research efforts have been recently dedicated to 3D scene reconstruction and understanding, with focus on scalable representation and natural language interaction.
