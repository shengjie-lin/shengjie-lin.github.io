I am currently a PhD student in computer science at [Toyota Technological Institute at Chicago](https://www.ttic.edu/) under the supervision of [Prof. Matthew R. Walter](https://home.ttic.edu/~mwalter/). Before coming to TTIC, I received the Bachelor's degree in Electronic Engineering at [Tsinghua University](https://www.tsinghua.edu.cn/en/), being awarded Outstanding Gradute and Outstanding Thesis by the department.

My research interests lie in the intersection of robotics, computer vision and machine learning. I am particularly interested in developing algorithms that enable robots to understand the surroundings and interact with it in a natural and intuitive way. My research efforts have been recently dedicated to 3D scene reconstruction and understanding, with focus on scalable representation and natural language interaction for embodied agents.

Besides research, I have also led several comphrehensive event-driven projects, which have been showcased in public exhibitions. These experiences grant me considerable practical knowledge not only in various software frameworks and tools for developing robotic applications, but also in project management and team collaboration. Notably, [baxter-pose-following](https://shengjie-lin.github.io/projects/1_project/), a project that I led, received great popularity during its showcase in the Museum of Science and Industry (Chicago), and was invited by the museum for regular exhibition since summer 2023.
