I am currently a Ph.D. candidate in computer science at [Toyota Technological Institute at Chicago](https://www.ttic.edu/) under the supervision of [Prof. Matthew R. Walter](https://home.ttic.edu/~mwalter/). Before joining TTIC, I received a bachelor's degree in electronic engineering at [Tsinghua University](https://www.tsinghua.edu.cn/en/), being awarded Outstanding Undergraduate and Outstanding Thesis by the department.

My research interests lie at the intersection of robotics, computer vision, and machine learning. I am particularly interested in developing algorithms that enable robots to understand and interact with their surroundings in a natural and intuitive way. My research efforts have been recently dedicated to 3D scene reconstruction and understanding, with a focus on scalable representation and natural language interaction for embodied agents.

Besides research, I have also led several comprehensive event-driven projects that have been showcased in public exhibitions. These experiences have granted me considerable practical knowledge of not only various software frameworks and tools for developing robotic applications, but also project management and team collaboration. Notably, [baxter-pose-following](https://shengjie-lin.github.io/projects/1_project/), a project I led, gained significant popularity when showcased at the Museum of Science and Industry in Chicago, and was subsequently invited for regular exhibition at the museum.
